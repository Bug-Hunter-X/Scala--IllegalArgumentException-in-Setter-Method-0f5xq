This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to exception handling within setter methods.  The `MyClass` example shows how an `IllegalArgumentException` can be thrown if an invalid value (in this case, a negative age) is attempted to be set via the `age_=` setter.  The solution highlights best practices for handling potential exceptions and ensuring more robust error handling.
